### About the Plugin:
This plugin originated from a now-abandoned server created in 2022 called Opicube. It has been developed to enhance the hub/lobby experience, offering features such as a scoreboard, a server selection menu, and compatibility with PlaceholderAPI and LuckPerms. Feel free to explore the functionalities and make your server's hub more engaging for players.

*Note: Make sure to install the required plugins (PlaceholderAPI and LuckPerms) for the proper functioning of this Hub/Lobby plugin.*
